# Cryptography & Privacy Portfolio

**Goal:**

Currently, I kind of want to split my focus between improving upon my encryption/development skills and looking into historical events or examples of cryptography & privacy. 

**Contents:**

- BAARS 4 Programm (end of semester poject from Fall 2020): Adding the baseline project to this repo. While the project currently makes use of an AES encryption scheme, I think a good lont-term goal for the semester would be to incorporate an Elliptic Curve scheme (perhaps with diffie-hellman) to either supplement or replace the current encryption algo. 

TODO: Find that Diffie-Hellman program that we made for discrete structures. Might be nice to include that.
