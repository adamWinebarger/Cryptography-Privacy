# Cryptography & Privacy Portfolio

**Goal:**

1. Learn how historical events were influenced by encryption

2. Learn about the evolution of encryption over time

3. Implement various encryption methods in a programming language

5. Implement encryption for messaging (maybe in discord) for possible class use

**Contents:**

- BAARS 4 Programm (end of semester poject from Fall 2020): Adding the baseline project to this repo. While the project currently makes use of an AES encryption scheme, I think a good lont-term goal for the semester would be to incorporate an Elliptic Curve scheme (perhaps with diffie-hellman) to either supplement or replace the current encryption algo. 

TODO: Find that Diffie-Hellman program that we made for discrete structures. Might be nice to include that.
