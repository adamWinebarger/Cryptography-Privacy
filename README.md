# Cryptography & Privacy Portfolio

**Goal:**

1. Learn how historical events were influenced by encryption

2. Learn about the evolution of encryption over time

3. Implement various encryption methods in a programming language

5. Implement encryption for messaging (maybe in discord) for possible class use

**Contents:**

- BAARS 4 Programm (end of semester poject from Fall 2020): Adding the baseline project to this repo. While the project currently makes use of an AES encryption scheme, I think a good lont-term goal for the semester would be to incorporate an Elliptic Curve scheme (perhaps with diffie-hellman) to either supplement or replace the current encryption algo. 
- Also added a loose collection of algorithms that I built using the notes from class. Currently a very rough work-in-progress as the original intent was to start merging some of these over to .NET/C# using the Windows Forms/WPF framework to make a nice all-in-one. Currently looking for a linux-based alternative. KDevelop has a framework for graphical apps that run C/C++ but it requires using a somewhat unique markup language. So that's a bit of a work in progress

TODO: Find that Diffie-Hellman program that we made for discrete structures. Might be nice to include that.

TODO: Learn QML?
